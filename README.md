#LavaS

Originally made in Skript - now in a brand-new flavor: Java!

## What is this?

Back in around 2010, there was a popular gamemode on classic Minecraft called Lava Survival.
We're bringing it back to modern Minecraft.
The point of the game was to escape the lava flood. You would have around 5 minutes to build.
Back then, lava could engulf an entire map due to a quirk with the liquid physics.

## Prerequisite

- Vault is required as an economy plugin. (I'll probably add support for custom economies)

It's recommended to have lots of RAM as well, many updates are called at once.

### Important note
Due to lava having lighting now, the lighting updates from the lava spreading cause massive amounts of lag for clients.
